# How much is your garage worth?

 Hi, this vanilla JS project aims to give users an ingame and real life value of their garage in the Grand Theft Auto online game.


## Project outline

The users will be provided with an input box to pick a vehicle from a provided database of ingame vehicles so they don't have to type out each vehicle data. The users will then manually input each vehicle into an empty array and rendered out on the site.


The database will contain the following data for each vehicle:
- ingame name
- ingame price
- name of the real life counterpart vehicle
- price of the real life counterpart vehicle




## Future goals

- enable adding images of each vehicle
- enable changing of the real life counterpart vehicle's name and price
- enable users to input vehicle upgrades to be factored into the vehicle's value
- automatically retrieve vehicles' specs from an API (if possible)
- automatically fill in all vehicles owned by the users using Social Club account details provided by the user (if possible)
- enable rendering of users' vehicles in a garage setting/background
- expansion into property portfolio value
